## 1. ✅ TypeScript Compilation Check

**Status:** ⚠️ Issues Found
**Errors:** 22
**Severity:** 🟡 High (not blocking, legacy code issues)

### Issues Found:

#### Issue #1: Legacy Phrase Type Usage
**Affected Files:**
- `src/screens/AdditionalFeaturesScreen.tsx` (6 errors)
- `src/screens/FavoritesScreen.tsx` (2 errors)
- `src/screens/PhraseDetailScreen.tsx` (9 errors)
- `src/screens/SearchScreen.tsx` (5 errors)

**Description:**
These screens are still using the old `Phrase` type instead of the new `PhraseWithTranslation` type. This is legacy code from before the multilingual system upgrade.

**Root Cause:**
The app was upgraded from a simple Chinese-Turkmen phrasebook to a multi-language system with `PhraseWithTranslation` type, but some screens weren't fully migrated.

**Impact:**
- Moderate - These screens may not display phrases correctly with the new language system
- Features work but may have incorrect data access patterns
- Type safety compromised in these modules

**Recommended Fix:**
Update these 4 screens to use `PhraseWithTranslation` and access phrases via:
- `phrase.translation.text` instead of `phrase.chinese` / `phrase.russian`
- `phrase.translation.transcription` instead of `phrase.pinyin`
- `phrase.turkmen` (remains the same)

**Priority:** 🟡 High
**Estimated Fix Time:** 1-2 hours
